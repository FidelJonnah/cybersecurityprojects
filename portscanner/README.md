This code takes a host and a list of ports as inputs, and returns a list of open ports on the host. 
function is_port_open takes a host and a port and returns True if the port is open and False otherwise. 
The function scan_ports takes a host and a list of ports and returns a list of open ports on the host.

This code is a basic implementation and can be improved by adding error handling, input validation, and more advanced functionality.
